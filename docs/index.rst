Demographic Inference in Polyploids
===================================

Welcome to our documentation for describing how to model demographic history
in polyploids using dadi. These docs describe several resources:
First, they present the technical/code-related aspects of the simulations and
analysis from our associated paper (link/citation below). Second, they describe
an example analysis of empirical data collected for allotetraploid
*Capsella bursa-pastoris*. And third, they provide an introductory tutorial
on how to construct simulations and demographic models for different types of
polyploids.

We recommend readers start with the :ref:`Tutorial`.
